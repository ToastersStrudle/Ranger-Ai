## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Discord Bot Token
- Internet connection for web verification

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\braxton\Downloads\RangerAI
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the bot**
   - Edit `config.json`
   - Add your Discord bot token
   - Set your Discord user ID as owner

4. **Run Ranger AI**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `config.json` to customize Ranger AI:

```json
{
    "bot_token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
    "owner_id": "YOUR_DISCORD_USER_ID",
    "learning_enabled": true,
    "web_verification_enabled": true,
    "self_improvement_enabled": true
}
```

### Key Settings

- **learning_enabled**: Enable/disable learning from conversations
- **web_verification_enabled**: Enable/disable web verification
- **self_improvement_enabled**: Enable/disable self-modification
- **verification_threshold**: Minimum confidence for knowledge storage (0.0-1.0)
- **learning_rate**: How quickly the bot learns (0.0-1.0)

## 📚 Commands

### User Commands
- `!learn <topic>` - Manually trigger learning about a topic
- `!knowledge <query>` - Query the bot's knowledge base
- `!status` - Show bot status and statistics

### Owner Commands
- `!improve` - Trigger self-improvement process
- `!backup` - Create a backup of the knowledge base
- `!export` - Export knowledge to JSON format

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Modules

1. **Learning Engine** (`modules/learning_engine.py`)
   - Extracts knowledge from conversations
   - Analyzes text patterns and sentiment
   - Manages learning parameters

2. **Web Verifier** (`modules/web_verifier.py`)
   - Searches multiple search engines
   - Verifies information accuracy
   - Evaluates source credibility

3. **Knowledge Base** (`modules/knowledge_base.py`)
   - Stores and retrieves learned information
   - Consolidates similar knowledge
   - Manages knowledge verification status

4. **Conversation Analyzer** (`modules/conversation_analyzer.py`)
   - Analyzes conversation context
   - Detects emotions and patterns
   - Tracks user interaction history

5. **Code Modifier** (`modules/code_modifier.py`)
   - Safely modifies bot code
   - Implements safety controls
   - Creates backups before changes

6. **Self Improvement** (`modules/self_improvement.py`)
   - Analyzes performance metrics
   - Suggests improvements
   - Triggers self-modification

## 🔒 Safety Features

### Code Modification Safety
- **Safety Patterns**: Prevents harmful code modifications
- **Backup System**: Creates backups before any changes
- **Validation**: Validates Python syntax before applying changes
- **Rollback**: Can restore from backups if modifications fail

### Web Verification Safety
- **Trusted Domains**: Only uses verified, trusted sources
- **Content Validation**: Verifies information accuracy
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents excessive web requests
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of web errors

## 📊 Monitoring

### Performance Metrics
- Response time and accuracy
- User satisfaction scores
- Knowledge coverage statistics
- Error rates and patterns

### Learning Statistics
- Total knowledge items stored
- Verification success rates
- Conversation analysis patterns
- Self-improvement history

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Features
1. Create new module in `modules/` directory
2. Import and initialize in `main.py`
3. Add configuration options to `config.json`
4. Update safety patterns if needed

### Modifying Learning Behavior
- Adjust `learning_rate` in config
- Modify verification thresholds
- Add new trusted domains
- Customize safety patterns

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bot not responding**
- Check Discord bot token in config.json
- Verify bot has proper permissions
- Check console for error messages

**Learning not working**
- Ensure `learning_enabled` is true in config
- Check database file permissions
- Verify internet connection for web verification

**Self-improvement errors**
- Check file permissions for code modification
- Verify safety patterns are not blocking legitimate changes
- Review backup directory permissions

### Logs
